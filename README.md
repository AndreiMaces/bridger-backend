This is the server of a service called "Bridger".
The service offers a user the capability to connect multiple phone's sensors to an web application through sockets.
This server is the middleware between the phone application and the client application which for instance could be a game 
or another type of application that uses sensors. One application of this type is accessible at bridger.macesandrei.com
